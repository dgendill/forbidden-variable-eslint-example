This repository contains an example ESLint rule that validates a function based on the comment that precedes it. For a more detailed explanation see my blog post [Writing an ESLint Rule That Depends on a Comment](https://www.dgendill.com/posts/programming/2019-04-02-eslint-custom-comment-rule.html).

To test, first run `npm install` and then `npm run test`.
